To install the required packages and run a Streamlit app, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
4. Install the required packages using pip by running the following command:
   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Once the installation is complete, you can run your Streamlit app. If your app file is named `app.py`, use the following command:

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
6. Your default web browser should automatically open a new tab displaying your Streamlit app. If it doesn't, you can manually open your browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
